This homework is so hard if you do not know python before taking this class. The amount of prerequisite knowledge to even finish task 1 is heavy.
Task 1 makes the assumption I already know how to use stuff from a different python file, ive never coded with python in my life, like the docs are
good but there are still some really important ones missing. (For example knowing how to)
