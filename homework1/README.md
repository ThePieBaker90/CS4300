The grading criteria of this assignment is as follows:
" Your assignment will be evaluated based on the correctness of your Python
code, the clarity of your comments and explanations, the effectiveness of pytest test cases, and your
application of advanced Python techniques such as metaprogramming and duck typing "

I do not know how you expect those of us who did not take the NON-REQUIRED python course to know this.
These are advanced techniques, I do not know why you expect every single person in your class to know 
python to this level when its not required for this class. Some of us took C#! Some of us said ooooo C++ 
looks better than dealing with that damned snake.

Its so fun to take a class and have a much harder time than everybody else just because you chose the wrong
class unknowingly 2 and a half years ago.

AI is a useful resource but with the current restirctions set out in the syllabus, it is still extremely difficult
to complete this assignment even with the help of AI short of asking the AI to program the assignment for me which I have 
to do with some of the further tasks which have techniques I've never even heard of.

Learning is extremely difficult and frustrating when you're forced to go through unnecessary obstacles. It just
feels like you are bashing your head against the wall. This entire assignment could be so much more accessible
and easier for everyone involved if it was in a language you could guaruntee everyone had a solid understanding of or a choice in 
the language they use.

2 Weeks isnt enough to learn what the university has an entire semester long course for.

This assignment was submitted unfinished because my machine got caught in a loop attempting to commit a git commit, I couldn't find a way to turn it off
other than the time-out which is past this assignments due date. Additionally, this assignment has enraged me so much (as you can see above) that I
do not think I have the mental capacity to finish it. Good day.
